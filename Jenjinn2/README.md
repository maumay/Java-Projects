# Jenjinn2
This is the source code for my chess engine written in Java and built on top of my JFlow library. I decided to write a chess engine as my first side project since it seemed to be just the right level of complexity for my skills at the time. This turned out to be fairly accurate, there were many difficulties but nothing that was insurmountable. Looking back I can say that I underestimated the difficulty of writing a strong engine and expecting performance comparable to that of the best chess engines was unrealistic. The completed version ended up at roughly the same level as myself, I have no appetite to keep working on improving the strength and would rather use my time on other projects. The engine can be played via a JavaFX application, for details please see the 'JenjinnFX' project which is also in this repository.

The test coverage is fairly thorough however documentation is admittedly a bit sparse, I have learnt the value of writing documention in an incremental fashion alongside the code itself so that I don't end up in a situation like this where I have masses of Javadoc to write in one go. The likelihood of this documentation getting written properly is now very low, I have better things to be doing with my free time than writing lots of Javadoc which will probably never be read anyway.
