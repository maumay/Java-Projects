/**
 * A sequential, single use iterator with lots of functionality in the style of
 * the {@link IntStream} interface. It bears a strong resemblance in that it
 * they are lazily-evaluated, possibly infinite sequences of values. It was
 * written with the intention of providing a cleaner API for common sequence
 * manipulations as well as providing the user more fine-grained control over
 * value consumption compared to streams. This finer control comes at the cost
 * of any potential parallelism in computations and therefore Flows should be
 * viewed as an accompaniment to Streams, not as replacements.
